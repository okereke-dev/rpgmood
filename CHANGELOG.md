# Changelog

## [1.4.0] — 2026-07-12

### Changed
- **Animals are no longer purchased** — `/rpgmood-farm animal buy` is gone. Instead, feed a wild cow/chicken/sheep/goat its normal vanilla breeding food (wheat, wheat seeds) and it's yours, the same interaction vanilla already uses for love mode. Nothing about that interaction is altered or cancelled — hearts, item consumption, and actual breeding (if a mate's nearby) all still happen exactly as vanilla intends; RPGMood just also registers the animal to whoever fed it and marks it persistent so it won't despawn.
- **Breeding grows the herd** — a newborn animal is automatically claimed by its parents' shared owner (or the owned parent's owner, if the other parent was wild). Parents with different owners, or two wild parents, leave the baby unclaimed.
- Claimed animals (befriended or bred) get no visible name tag or floating nameplate — `AnimalData.name` is auto-generated (`"<Type> #N"`) for messages only, nothing renders in the world. `/rpgmood-farm animal list` and looking at one with a stick are how you check what's yours.
- `farming.animals.purchasing` (per-type item costs) is gone from `farming.yml` — there's no economy left to configure.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- **Zone `flavor_texts` never rotated** — for configured zones, the action-bar flavor line always showed `flavor_texts[0]`, forever, regardless of how many lines were written. Fixed by folding `subtitle` + `flavor_texts` into one pool and picking a line (deterministically, varying by location) to show *as* the Title's Subtitle — no separate action-bar message anymore, so it also can't be interrupted by anything else.
- **Action-bar messages getting stomped** — ambient time/weather messages, zone flavor, and farming/animal feedback (harvesting, feeding, petting, etc.) were four independent, uncoordinated systems fighting for the same action-bar line; whichever fired last won, often less than a second after the previous one appeared. Zone feedback moved off action bar entirely (see above); `MessageService.send()` now resends action-bar messages twice over ~2s so they survive a vanilla fade-out or a later message, with a per-player generation check so a stale resend can never overwrite a newer message.
- **Farming/animal feedback bypassing `MessageService`** — `CropListener`, `AnimalInteractListener`, `AnimalProductTask`, and `CookingListener` called `Player.sendActionBar()` directly, skipping the player's delivery-mode preference and the sticky-resend behavior above. All routed through `MessageService` now.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added
- **16 new achievements** (15 → 31 total), grouped into a new `Category` (Exploration/Combat/Survival/Farming/Loot) shown in `/rpgmood achievements`:
  - Exploration: Cartographer (discover every configured zone)
  - Combat: Untouchable (damage-free kill), Godslayer (kill all 4 major bosses), Overkill (level 30+ kill that drops a Legendary RPGLoot item)
  - Survival: Storm Chaser (survive a lightning strike), Death Tourist (die in 8 biomes)
  - Farming: Four Seasons, Noah's Ark, Beloved, Green Thumb
  - Loot: Legendary Hunter, Relic Bearer, Godslayer's Arsenal, Matching Set, Head to Toe, Dressed to Kill
- **RPGLoot integration** — six new Loot achievements read RPGLoot's item/player `PersistentDataContainer` tags directly (no Maven dependency either way, same soft-integration convention RPGLoot already uses to read `rpgmood:level`). New `RPGLootIntegration` and `RPGLootAchievementListener`.
- `SeasonManager`'s season-change broadcast now actually unlocks `seasons_first`/`four_seasons` — it never did before (a gap from 1.2.0: the achievement was defined but never wired to the season-change event).

### Fixed
- `AchievementManager.ALL_ACHIEVEMENTS` was a `Set.of(...)`, so `/rpgmood achievements` rendered in unspecified (JVM-dependent) order. Switched to an ordered `List`.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Public API for developers** — `PlayerZoneChangeEvent`, `MobScaleEvent`, `PlayerDeathMessageEvent`, `PlayerCropHarvestEvent` (`com.ricardo.rpgmood.api`), so other plugins (e.g. loot plugins) can hook into RPGMood without a hard dependency
- **bStats metrics** — registered with a real plugin ID
- **Mob level particle auras** (`MobAuraEffect`) — subtle, level-tiered coloured particles around scaled mobs (blue/yellow/orange/red as level increases), only rendered for mobs near a player
- **Achievement system** — 15 achievements across exploration, combat, farming, and survival (`AchievementManager`), persisted to `achievements.yml`; `/rpgmood achievements` shows unlocked/locked progress
- **Action-bar ambient messages** (`MessageService`) — ambient/zone/achievement messages now default to the action bar instead of chat, with a per-player toggle
- **Harvest Moon-style farming module** (`com.ricardo.rpgmood.farming`):
  - Crop quality (Bronze/Silver/Gold) based on soil fertility, nearby water, weather, and zone danger
  - Four-season cycle (Spring/Summer/Autumn/Winter, 30 MC days each) affecting growth rate and available crops
  - Cooking & recipe discovery — recipes are learned by experimenting in a crafting table and grant temporary "Mood" buffs (Fortified, Comforted, Inspired, Agotado)
  - Animal husbandry — buy, name, feed, and collect products from cows/chickens/sheep/goats (`/rpgmood-farm animal buy|list|info`)
  - `/rpgmood-farm season|crops|recipes [all]|animal` command
  - Recipe discovery now persists to `recipes.yml` across restarts

### Fixed
- **`MessageService.toggle()` rewriting the whole config** — now delegates to `ConfigManager.savePlayerToggle()` like the rest of the player toggles, instead of calling `saveConfig()` directly

## [1.1.1] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **Biome bonuses for variant biomes** (`MobScalingService.getBiomeBonus()`) — biomes like MEADOW, SUNFLOWER_PLAINS, BAMBOO_JUNGLE now correctly inherit bonuses from their parent biome group (PLAINS, FOREST, JUNGLE, etc.) instead of always returning 0
- **Structure scan lag** (`MobScalingService.scanStructureBonus()`) — increased grid cache granularity from 128→512 blocks and added chunk-generation pre-checks to avoid expensive `locateNearestStructure()` calls in ungenerated areas; structure cache is now invalidated on `/rpgmood reload`
- **Zone fuzzy matching** (`ZoneManager.isBiomeMatch()`) — tightened pattern matching with underscore-delimited tokens to prevent false-positive matches (e.g. "FOR" no longer matches "FOREST")
- **Diary page overflow** (`DiarioCommand`) — replaced fixed-entry-per-page layout with dynamic character-aware page splitting to respect Minecraft's 256-char book page limit
- **Excessive disk I/O** (`PlayerStatsService`) — stat saves are now debounced (5s window), coalescing multiple rapid changes into a single write
- **Memory leaks** (`AmbientTask`) — added periodic eviction (every 5 min) of stale entries from `lastTriggeredEvents` and `lastWeatherType` maps
- **Biome alias mismatch** (`DeathMessageListener`) — aligned `BIOME_ALIAS` with `ZoneManager.BIOME_GROUP` so forest, mushroom, and end biomes map consistently across both systems
- **Non-contextual death messages** (`DeathMessageListener.selectMessage()`) — replaced random-category mixing with priority-based selection: killer > cause > biome > armed > fallback; each message is now thematically relevant
- **Config toggle efficiency** (`RPGMoodCommand`) — `/rpgmood toggle` now persists only the player's toggle value instead of rewriting the entire `config.yml`

### Added
- `MobScalingService.invalidateStructureCache()` — public method for cache invalidation
- `ConfigManager.savePlayerToggle()` — targeted persistence for player preference toggles
- New biome sections in `config.yml` (`forest`, `mushroom`, `end`) with location names, descriptors, and flavour text for complete biome coverage

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Bonus XP on kill** — killing a scaled mob grants XP proportional to its level (`mob_scaling.bonus_xp_per_level`)
- **High-level mob announcements** — server-wide broadcast when a dangerously scaled mob spawns (configurable threshold/cooldown)
- **Cross-plugin level exposure** — every scaled mob's level is stored via `PersistentDataContainer` (`rpgmood:level`) for other plugins (e.g. loot plugins) to read
- **Leaderboard** — `/rpgmood leaderboard [deaths|zones|level]`, persisted in `stats.yml`
- **Zone particles** — the `particles` field in `zones.yml` (previously unused) now actually spawns particles on zone entry
- **PvP death messages** — a player killed by another player now gets a `killers.player` message naming the actual killer, instead of falling back to generic wilderness flavor text
- Per-biome location name descriptors (plains, dark_forest, desert, taiga, snowy_taiga, jungle, swamp, ocean, nether_wastes) in addition to the shared `default` pool
- **Zone title hysteresis** — a zone change now needs a short dwell time (1.5s on foot, 3s while gliding/riding a vehicle) before feedback fires, eliminating title spam from border pacing and fast pass-throughs on horseback, boat, minecart, or elytra
- **Tiered zone feedback** — the big Title/Subtitle now has its own 5-minute "seen recently" memory per zone (separate from the ambient sound/chat cooldown) and a shorter duration while moving fast, so it doesn't linger over your view
- `/rpgmood toggle titles` — opt out of just the Title/Subtitle overlay while keeping sound and chat flavor
- Fixed: `/rpgmood toggle` (master) is now actually respected by zone feedback — previously it only affected time/weather ambient messages

### Removed
- **Emotes** (`/emote`) — removed entirely rather than kept as a single generic, unfinished effect

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-04

Initial release.

### Features
- **Mob scaling** — hostile mobs gain levels based on distance from spawn, biome, nearby structures, and nearby player count
- **Zones** — biome-based and WorldGuard region-based zones with custom titles, subtitles, sounds, particles, and flavor text; unclaimed areas get procedurally-assigned dynamic zone names
- **Adventure journal** (`/diary`) — a written book of the player's recent zone arrivals and deaths, persisted per-player
- **Narrative death messages** — biome-, cause-, and killer-aware flavor text with configurable location names
- **Ambient time/weather events** — scheduled messages and sounds on time-of-day and weather transitions (`triggers.yml`)
- **Block break triggers** — chance-based ambient messages on breaking configured blocks
- **Emotes** (`/emote`) — short particle/sound effect
- Soft-integrates with **PlaceholderAPI** (`%rpgmood_zone%`, `%rpgmood_area_danger%`) and **WorldGuard** (region-type zones)
- Admin command `/rpgmood reload|toggle|info` — `info` shows the current zone and mob difficulty at your location for tuning `config.yml`

### Configuration
- `config.yml` — mob scaling curve, messages, death message templates
- `zones.yml` — zone definitions (BIOME / WORLDGUARD)
- `triggers.yml` — time, weather, and block-break ambient events
